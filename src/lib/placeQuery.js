/**
 * Where a query (a search, an abstract) lands on the map (#100). UMAP and t-SNE have no
 * transform for new points in the browser, so this is an out-of-sample placement by nearest
 * neighbours, which works for any projection, live or aligned (#82):
 * - the `k` papers most similar to `vector` (cosine: the embeddings are L2-normalized) among
 *   those with a position (`positions[i]` = [x, y] where paper i is drawn, null if not on the map);
 * - their positions averaged with weights exp((s - s_max) / temperature): the most similar
 *   paper counts fully and one 0.05 less similar about a third, so a paper's own embedding lands
 *   next to its own dot and a query lands among its closest matches rather than at the centroid of
 *   ten loosely related papers;
 * - `spread`: the weighted root-mean-square distance of those neighbours from the placement, in
 *   map units. Neighbours scattered over the map (the projection split them) make it large: the
 *   position is approximate, and the map draws it as a halo of that radius.
 *
 * Returns {x, y, spread, neighbours: [{index, similarity}] (most similar first)}, or null when
 * no paper has a position.
